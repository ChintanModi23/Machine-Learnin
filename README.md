Machine Learning Projects

Implemented Machine Learning Classifier and Algorithms from scratch in Python such as :
- Naive Bayes Classifier
- Gradient Descent for minimizing the Least Squares Loss
- Optimizing the SVM hinge loss
- Logistic Discrimination Gradient Descent
- K-means clustering
- Gini Index / Best Split Finder Algorithm
- Classification using Random Hyperplanes

Using Datasets Breast Cancer, hill valley, climate simulation, ionosphere, micromass, qsar_biodeg from UCI ML Repository
